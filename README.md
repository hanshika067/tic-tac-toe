Project Overview:
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using C programming. The game allows two players to take turns and play a classic 3x3 grid game, choosing between 'X' and 'O' as their marks. The game continues until one player wins by aligning three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a draw if all spaces are filled without a winner.

Features:
Two-Player Mode: Players alternate between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).

Board Representation: A 3x3 board is displayed using an array and updated after each playerâ€™s move.

Input Validation: The program checks whether a move is valid (i.e., the chosen cell is not already occupied).

Win Condition: The game detects if a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.

Game Flow: After each turn, the board is re-rendered, showing the current state of the game.

How to Play:
Players are prompted to enter a number (1-9) corresponding to an empty spot on the board.

Player 1 uses X, and Player 2 uses O.

The game will display the current board after each move.

The game ends when one player wins, or if all the squares are filled resulting in a draw.
